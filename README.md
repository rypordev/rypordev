**`New-grad SDE (Java, C#, C++)`**

I'm a 2023 computer science, applied math, and music graduate, looking to dive into all kinds of software development work. I have prior experience as an intern at Amazon and a background in hobbyist game development. I love algorithms and optimizations, and hope deepen my understanding of code and problem solving through my time in the industry.

Currently, I am learning shaders, and working on a fun party game based on Splatoon, but with tanks.
